# Hi, I’m Evelyn Adams
I began studying computational mathematics at the University of Central Florida in the Fall of 2020; where I discovered my passion for computer science when taking an introduction to programming course. I added a minor in computer Science the same semester and have throughly enjoyed it thus far.  

On this site you will find that I have posted some of my personal and course projects.[^1]  Currently this includes explorations of the C and Java languages.  



As you may have noticed, I have organized my works into repositories by the coding language in wich they were written. Any work that was done for a class has been clearly labeled as acedemic property and should not be copied for other acedemic purposes. 

If your intrested in contacting me or seeing a more up to date history of my carrer thus far, connect with me on Linked in!

[^1]: I do NOT condone the use of my acedemic works or code being used for academic dishonesty. No grade is worth the risk of being cited for academic dishonesty. If you find my code because you are lost on an assignment please contact me on LinkedIn and I would be more than happy to help you move in the right direction as to topics to reference and study so that you actually understand what you are turing in.
